here's most of my available stuff!! yippie!!!<br>
likely where most of my time has gone.<br>
<br>
<a href="assets/mainfnafpack.zip">fnaf 123 model pack</a><br>
<img height="10vh" src="assets/mainfnafpack.png"><br>
this is like 90% of my models, being the big fnaf pack.<br>
here we have models for fnaf 1, fnaf 2, and fnaf 3.<br>
i do intend on redoing half of these guys (and refactoring the other half) and have already redone some of them too.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2867739715&searchtext=Spring+Bonnie">bonnierabbit sfm workshop model</a><br>
here's just the bonnierabbit model from the 123 pack except for sfm. felt like porting one day yk.<br>
<br>
<a href="assets/springsv5.zip">springs v5 model pack</a><br>
<img height="10vh" src="assets/springsv5.png"><br>
redone versions of a couple of the models seen in the 123 pack.<br>
these are kinda some of my most recent, even though they're old and crap to me by now.<br>
i still plan on using these, at most just a refactor of their shaders or giving them proper endoskelletons. they're good<br>
<br>
i don't think i've release anything else so far but i intend on doing so once anything is finilised.<br>
or once i bother adding them here even though they're not really meant for public use.
