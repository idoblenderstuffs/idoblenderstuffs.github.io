here's my favourite open source projects i am or have been working on: <br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/idoblenderstuffs/ubgonline">ubg online</a><br>
this is an unblocked games website that i was making for people in my school<br>
no matter what i could do, it was still blocked under my school's wifi, sadly.<br>
however, this is actually the only open source project i've posted that anybody's cared about, as there are a couple alternatives that do actually work on my school wifi such as <a href="https://github.com/schoolworkhelper/schoolworkhelper.github.io">schoolworkhelper</a> so i'm quite proud of that<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/idoblenderstuffs/crappy-mc-terrain">crappy-mc-terrin</a><br>
i made this in a couple weeks for my secondary school art gcse. i'm aware i could've done something far easier but i felt like a challenge.<br>
it's slow and really bad, but it was fun an interesting to make. it definitely helped me improve as a programmer.<br>
the full unity files aren't on this repository, but just the two c# scripts made for it. theres little set up to figure out how to reimpliment this yourself, and i didn't expect anybody to want to do that in the first place so i purely used this as a way to show off the code inside.<br>
i have a full page talking about this <a href="articles/article21.html">here</a><br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/idoblenderstuffs/idosourcetools">idosourcetools</a><br>
these are some tools i created for porting blender models into source film maker, or any other source engine games and programs out there supposedly.<br>
there's two versions available: one for windows and one in the browser. i never finished the browser version, so i'd reccomend the windows one, but it's probably not that useful anyways.<br>
i used these myself for all of my sfm ports back in the day, which although i only uploaded a couple to the workshop, i had worked on a lot more ports than i could possibly recount to you.<br>
you can find a full page about this <a href="articles/article26.html">here</a><br>
one of the models i ported using these tools has a page <a href="articles/article7.html">here</a>
