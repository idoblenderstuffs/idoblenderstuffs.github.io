my first mod for supertuxkart, being the cat nonce himself.<br>
play as tyler oldham, riding in his disturbed ginger cat!<br>
<br>
<strong>how to install on windows</strong><br>
1) press windows+r to open "run"<br>
2) type in "%appdata%" and hit enter<br>
3) go to supertuxkart > addons > karts<br>
4) unzip the file here and it should be installed<br>
(make sure to check that its only one folder called tyleroldham)<br>
<br>
likely gonna make more mods and end up making it as one page<br>
dunno when ill do that though
