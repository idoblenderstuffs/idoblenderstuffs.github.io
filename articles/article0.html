finally deciding to use my website for absolutely anything. any further youtube community posts will now also appear on my site's main page at idoblenderstuffs.github.io. i've been meaning to do this for a long time but i've never been able to settle on a design, which has now finally come. it should be the real source of all of my projects, not just my youtube channel being that, and should have articles on basically anything i've actually done. or at least, anything i can remember doing. i'm still working on putting anything on each of the pages but at least the main feed, where you'll see this, should be there.
